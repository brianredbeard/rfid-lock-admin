            (This popup should go away; then the change_form should refresh so that superusers see the number there and non-superusers don't see the number but see the other signs that mean that a keycard is assigned and is active, like the place by "Manage keycard" that says whether or not lock user has an active keycard, and which options of "assign new keycard" and "deactivate current keycard" are functional.

            Note that the "Save" is really "Save and Assign" - the association with this LockUser already happens by the time back at the form.  
            Also, since manage keycards stuff will actually be below everything else and the save bar -- i.e. saving everything else about the
            lockuser is a separate thing.... so that refreshing when come back out of the popup doesn't screw things up/lose things.  The manage
            keycards bar will now reflect that that user now has active keycard. The superuser should see the fields listing current and all
            rfid's have changed.)

MORE OR LESS DEPRECATED BRAINVOMIT:

The best thing would be to override the block with the save, etc. buttons at the bottom... But, that's harder than it sounds (solutions involve hacky stuff with javascript!).  Or that's what people on the internet think.  But here's what you can do, I think: submit_row is a template tag.  Look at the code for that, and create your own custom template tag that's similar but includes the extra behavior. 
{% block submit_buttons_bottom %}{% submit_row %}{% endblock %}


{% block submit_buttons_bottom %}
Or move in here? 
     {{block.super}}
{% endblock %}
